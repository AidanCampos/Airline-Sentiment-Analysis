# Airline Sentiment Analysis Project

## Background

The increasingly vast amount of data created by social media users offers businesses valuable insights into customer sentiment of their products and services. However, large amounts of semi structured data can be difficult to make sense of and warrants the implementation of algorithims by businesses to monitor social media activity. This can allow businesses to increase overall customer satisfaction and make improvements on product lines or services.

## Objective

Conduct a sentiment analysis of tweets from airline passengers and develop key business insights.
